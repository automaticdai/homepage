## Introduction

I am a research associate in the [Real-Time Systems Research Group (RTSRG)](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/index.html) at the University of York, UK. 
I am currently working on the [MOCHA research project](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/mocha/), which focuses on modelling and scheduling of complex architectures with high performance and stringent timing requirements.
Before this I worked on the [DEIS project](https://deis-project.eu), which involves model-based safety assurance ([Structured Assurance Case Metamodel, SACM](https://www.omg.org/spec/SACM/2.0/About-SACM/)) that is applicable to autonomous and cyber-physical systems, collaborated with AVL, Siemens, General Motor and Fraunhofer.

## Biography

Xiaotian Dai received a PhD degree from University of York in 2019 (with Best Thesis). He joined real-time systems group in 2015 as a PhD research student, supervised by [Prof. Alan Burns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/). His PhD research involves cooperatively design of control system and real-time task scheduling for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Flexible scheduling task models and methods are proposed and implemented to investigate the scheduling impact on control performance.
He received a MSc in Control Systems from the University of Sheffield in 2014, and a BSc in Automatic Control in 2011.
