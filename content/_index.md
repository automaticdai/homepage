## Introduction

I am a research associate on the MOCHA research project, working with [Prof. Iain Bate](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ijb/) and [Prof. Alan Burns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/) in the [Real-Time and Distributed Systems Research Group (RTDS)](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/index.html). The MOCHA project focuses on modelling, scheduling and allocation of complex many-core architectures that have high performance and stringent timing requirements, using novel methods including Digital Twins. The project is targeted for key techniques of the next-generation 5G/6G communication base stations. You can know more on the [MOCHA project website](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/mocha/).

Before MOCHA, I worked on the [H2020 DEIS project](https://deis-project.eu) in 2019 with [Prof. Tim Kelly](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/tpk) and [Dr. Ibrahim Habli](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/ihabli). The DEIS project involves developing of model-based safety assurance language (using [Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM)](https://www.omg.org/spec/SACM/2.0/About-SACM/); now is an OMG standard) and tools that is applicable to model-based autonomous and cyber-physical systems. This project was collaborated with AVL, Siemens, General Motor and Fraunhofer. 

My current research is mainly focus on real-time scheduling, cyber-physical system design and analysis with an emphasis on improving scheduling flexibility and adaptiveness. My reseach has lead to many novel modelling, scheduling and analysis methods as well as hardware for system with timing requirements. I also work on timing predictability of autonomous and robotic systems to ensure their safety, robustness and resilience.

## Biography

Xiaotian Dai is a research associate at the University of York, UK. He received a PhD degree from University of York in 2019 (with Best Thesis). He joined real-time systems group at York in 2015 as a PhD research student, supervised by Prof. Alan Burns. His PhD research involves cooperatively design of control system and real-time task scheduling for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), in which various flexible scheduling task models are proposed and implemented to investigate the scheduling impact on control performance. He received a M.Sc. in Control Systems from the University of Sheffield in 2014, and a B.Sc. in Automatic Control in 2011. He serves as a reviewer and a PC member for many IEEE/ACM real-time, embedded and design automation conferences and journals.
