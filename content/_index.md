## About

I am a Lecturer (~assistant professor) at the Department of Computer Science, University of York, United Kingdom. My research interest is scheduling and verification of real-time and cyber-physical systems. To be more specific, my research is mainly focused on timing analysis and improving scheduling flexibility and adaptiveness over the lifetime, leaning towards applications in cyber-physical systems, robots and autonomous cars. My research has led to many novel modelling, scheduling and analysis methodologies as well as hardware for systems with stringent timing requirements, some of which have been adopted by the industry. I am also active in the robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) community and my research is to ensure their safety, robustness and resilience.

## Short Bio

I was a Research Associate on the [MOCHA research project](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/mocha/), working with [Prof. Iain Bate](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ijb/) and [Prof. Alan Burns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/) in the [Real-Time and Distributed Systems Research Group (RTDS)](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/index.html), funded by Huawei. The MOCHA project focuses on modelling, scheduling and allocation of complex many-core architectures that have high performance and stringent timing requirements, using novel methods including Digital Twins and cache-aware scheduling. The project is targeted at providing key techniques of the next-generation 5G/6G communication base stations.

Before MOCHA, I worked on the EU H2020 [DEIS project](https://deis-project.eu) in 2019 with [Prof. Tim Kelly](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/tpk) and [Prof. Ibrahim Habli](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/ihabli). The DEIS project involves developing model-based safety assurance language (using [Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM)](https://www.omg.org/spec/SACM/2.0/About-SACM/); now is an OMG standard) and tools that are applicable to model-based autonomous and cyber-physical systems. This project was collaborated with AVL, Siemens, General Motors and Fraunhofer.

I joined the real-time systems group at York in 2015 as a PhD student, supervised by [Prof. Alan Burns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/), and I was awarded a PhD degree in 2019 with Best Thesis. I received an MSc with distinction in Automatic Control and Systems Engineering from the University of Sheffield in 2014, and a BSc in Automatic Control in 2011. I have published over 30 papers and also regularly serve as a TPC member and reviewer for various prestigious conferences and journals in the domains of real-time systems, embedded systems, robotics and design automation.
