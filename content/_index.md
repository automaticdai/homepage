## Introduction

I am a research associate in the [Real-Time Systems Research Group (RTSRG)](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/index.html) at the University of York. I am currently working on the MOCHA research project, which focuses on modelling and scheduling of complex architectures with high performance and stringent timing requirements. 
Before this I worked on model-based safety assurance (SACM) that is applicable to autonomous and cyber-physical systems. This work was worked in collaboration with AVL, Siemens, General Motor and Fraunhofer. 

I was awarded PhD in 2019 in the Computer Science Department at University of York. I joined RTSRG in 2015 as a PhD student, supervised by [Prof. Alan Burns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/) and [Prof. Neil Audsley](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~neil/Neil_Audsley.html). My PhD research involves cooperatively design of control system and real-time task scheduling for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Flexible scheduling task models and methods are proposed and implemented to investigate the scheduling impact on control performance. 
I was awarded MSc in 2014 in Control Systems at the University of Sheffield, and a BSc (2011) in Automatic Control in China. During my undergraduate and postgraduate study, I was involved in a wide range of autonomous robot research and developments.

I am also a robot enthusiast and a strong believer in a future with AI & robots.
