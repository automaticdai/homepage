## About

*I am starting a new position as a Lecturer (Assitant Professor) in June 2023 at the Department of Computer Science, University of York.*

Currently, I am a Research Associate on the [MOCHA research project](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/mocha/), working with [Prof. Iain Bate](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ijb/) and [Prof. Alan Burns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/) in the [Real-Time and Distributed Systems Research Group (RTDS)](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/index.html), funded by Huawei.
The MOCHA project focuses on modelling, scheduling and allocation of complex many-core architectures that have high performance and stringent timing requirements, using novel methods including Digital Twins and cache-aware scheduling. The project is targeted for providing key techniques of the next-generation 5G/6G communication base stations.

Before MOCHA, I worked on the EU H2020 [DEIS project](https://deis-project.eu) in 2019 with [Prof. Tim Kelly](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/tpk) and [Prof. Ibrahim Habli](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/ihabli). The DEIS project involves developing of model-based safety assurance language (using [Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM)](https://www.omg.org/spec/SACM/2.0/About-SACM/); now is an OMG standard) and tools that is applicable to model-based autonomous and cyber-physical systems. This project was collaborated with AVL, Siemens, General Motor and Fraunhofer.

My research is mainly focus on real-time and cyber-physical systems, focusing on timing analysis and improving scheduling flexibility and adaptiveness over lifetime, leaning towards applications in robotics and autonomous systems. My research has led to many novel modelling, scheduling and analysis methods as well as hardware for systems with timing requirements. I am also extensively working on scheduling and timing predictability of robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) to ensure their safety, robustness and resilience.

### Biography

Xiaotian Dai is a Research Associate at the University of York, UK. He joined real-time systems group at York in 2015 as a PhD research student, supervised by Prof. Alan Burns, where he was awarded a PhD degree in 2019 with Best Thesis. He received an MSc with distinction in Automatic Control and Systems Engineering from the University of Sheffield in 2014, and a BSc in Automatic Control in 2011. His research is mainly in real-time systems, which involves cooperatively design of cyber-physical system and real-time task scheduling, with various flexible scheduling task models and analysis proposed and implemented to investigate the timing of cyber-physical systems with multi- and many-cores. He has published more than 20 papers and serves as a regular TPC member and reviewer for various real-time, embedded, robotics and design automation conferences and journals.
