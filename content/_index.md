## Introduction

I am a research associate in the [Real-Time Systems Research Group (RTSRG)](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/index.html) at the University of York, UK. 
I am currently working on the [MOCHA research project](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/mocha/) with [Dr. Iain Bate](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ijb/). The MOCHA project focuses on modelling and scheduling of complex architectures with high performance and stringent timing requirements for next-generation communication stations.
Before this project, I worked on the [H2020 DEIS project](https://deis-project.eu), which involves model-based safety assurance ([Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM)](https://www.omg.org/spec/SACM/2.0/About-SACM/)) that is applicable to autonomous and cyber-physical systems, which was collaborated with AVL, Siemens, General Motor and Fraunhofer.

My research is mainly in real-time scheduling with a focus on improving system flexibility and adaptivity. I also do research to improve timing predictability of autonomous systems/cyber-physical systems to ensure safety and resilience. 
I make robots as part of my research or as my part-time entertainment. You can find more about these projects on this page: [Robot Projects](http://xiaotiandai.com/robots/).
I also have an educational blog on real-time systems, if you want to learn more about real-time / embedded systems, you can visit it here: [Real-time System Blog](http://blog.xiaotiandai.com).

## Biography

Xiaotian Dai received a PhD degree from University of York in 2019 (with Best Thesis). He joined real-time systems group in 2015 as a PhD research student, supervised by [Prof. Alan Burns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/). His PhD research involves cooperatively design of control system and real-time task scheduling for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Flexible scheduling task models and methods are proposed and implemented to investigate the scheduling impact on control performance.
He received a MSc in Control Systems from the University of Sheffield in 2014, and a BSc in Automatic Control in 2011.
