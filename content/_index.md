## Introduction

I am currently a research associate working on the [MOCHA research project](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/mocha/) with [Dr. Iain Bate](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ijb/) in the [Real-Time Systems Research Group (RTSRG)](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/index.html). 

The MOCHA project focuses on modelling and scheduling of complex many-core architectures with high performance and stringent timing requirements, which is for next-generation 5G communication stations.
Before this project, I worked on the [H2020 DEIS project](https://deis-project.eu) in 2019, which involves model-based safety assurance (using [Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM)](https://www.omg.org/spec/SACM/2.0/About-SACM/), an OMG standard) that is applicable to autonomous and cyber-physical systems, collaborating with AVL, Siemens, General Motor and Fraunhofer.

My research is mainly on real-time scheduling and system design with a focus on improving system flexibility and adaptiveness. I also have published work in improving timing predictability of autonomous systems/cyber-physical systems to ensure safety, robustness and resilience. 

As part of my research and as a hobby, I make robotic and electronic projects in part-time. You can find more about these projects on this page: [robot projects](/robots/). I maintain a tracking page of real-time/embedded systems conferences: [RTS conference tracking](https://automaticdai.github.io/realtime-embedded-conferences/).

## Biography

Xiaotian Dai is a research associate at the University of York, UK. He received a PhD degree from University of York in 2019 (with Best Thesis). He joined real-time systems group in 2015 as a PhD research student, supervised by [Prof. Alan Burns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/). His PhD research involves cooperatively design of control system and real-time task scheduling for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Various flexible scheduling task models and methods are proposed and implemented to investigate the scheduling impact on control performance.
He received a MSc in Control Systems from the University of Sheffield in 2014, and a BSc in Automatic Control in 2011.
