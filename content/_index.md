## Introduction

I am a postdoctoral research associate on the MOCHA research project working with [Prof. Iain Bate](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ijb/) and [Prof. Alan Burns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/) in the [Real-Time Systems Research Group (RTSRG)](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/index.html). The MOCHA project focuses on modelling, scheduling and allocation of complex many-core architectures that have high performance and stringent timing requirements. The project is targeted for the next-generation 5G/6G communication base stations. You can know more about MOCHA [on the project website](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/mocha/).

Before MOCHA, I worked on the [H2020 DEIS project](https://deis-project.eu) in 2019 with [Prof. Tim Kelly](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/tpk) and [Dr. Ibrahim Habli](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/ihabli). The DEIS project involves developing of model-based safety assurance language (using [Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM)](https://www.omg.org/spec/SACM/2.0/About-SACM/); submitted as an OMG standard) and tools that is applicable to model-based autonomous and cyber-physical systems. This project was collaborated with AVL, Siemens, General Motor and Fraunhofer.

My research is mainly focus on real-time scheduling, cyber-physical system design and anlysis with an emphasis on improving scheduling flexibility and adaptiveness. My reseach has lead to some novel scheduling and co-design methods as well as predictable hardware for system with timing requirements. I also work on timing predictability for autonomous, robotic and cyber-physical systems to ensure their safety, robustness and resilience.

## Biography

Xiaotian Dai is a research associate at the University of York, UK. He received a PhD degree from University of York in 2019 (with Best Thesis). He joined real-time systems group in 2015 as a PhD research student, supervised by Prof. Alan Burns. His PhD research involves cooperatively design of control system and real-time task scheduling for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), where various flexible scheduling task models are proposed and implemented to investigate the scheduling impact on control performance. He received a M.Sc. in Control Systems from the University of Sheffield in 2014, and a B.Sc. in Automatic Control in 2011. He serves as a reviewer and a PC member for many top real-time, embedded and design automation conferences.
