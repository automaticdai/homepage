## Introduction

I am a research associate in the [Real-Time Systems Research Group (RTSRG)](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/index.html) at the University of York, UK. 
I am currently working on the [MOCHA research project](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/mocha/), which focuses on modelling and scheduling of complex architectures with high performance and stringent timing requirements.
Before this I worked on the [DEIS project](https://deis-project.eu), which involves model-based safety assurance ([Structured Assurance Case Metamodel, SACM](https://www.omg.org/spec/SACM/2.0/About-SACM/)) that is applicable to autonomous and cyber-physical systems, collaborated with AVL, Siemens, General Motor and Fraunhofer.

## Biography

Xiaotian Dai received a PhD degree from University of York in 2019 (with Best Thesis). He joined RTSRG in 2015 as a PhD student, supervised by [Prof. Alan Burns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/) and [Prof. Neil Audsley](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~neil/Neil_Audsley.html). His PhD research involves cooperatively design of control system and real-time task scheduling for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Flexible scheduling task models and methods are proposed and implemented to investigate the scheduling impact on control performance.
He received MSc in Control Systems from the University of Sheffield in 2014, and a BSc in Automatic Control in 2011.
