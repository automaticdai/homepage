## Introduction

I am a postdoctoral research associate working on the MOCHA research project with [Dr. Iain Bate](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ijb/) and [Prof. Alan Burns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/) in the [Real-Time Systems Research Group (RTSRG)](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/index.html). 
The MOCHA project focuses on modelling and scheduling of complex many-core architectures with high performance and stringent timing requirements, which is for next-generation 5G communication stations. You can know more about MOCHA project [on this website](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/mocha/).

Before MOCHA, I worked on the [H2020 DEIS project](https://deis-project.eu) in 2018-2019. The DEIS project involves model-based safety assurance (using OMG standard [Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM)](https://www.omg.org/spec/SACM/2.0/About-SACM/)) that is applicable to autonomous and cyber-physical systems. This project was collaborated with AVL, Siemens, General Motor and Fraunhofer.

My research is mainly on real-time scheduling and system design with a focus on improving scheduling flexibility and adaptiveness. I also have published work in timing predictability of autonomous, robotic and cyber-physical systems to ensure safety, robustness and resilience. 

As part of my research and as a hobby, I make robotic / electronic projects in part-time. You can find more about these projects on this page: [robot projects](/robots/). I have an educational [blog on real-time systems](https://blog.xiaotiandai.com). I maintain a tracking page of real-time / embedded systems conferences on this page: [real-time systems conference tracking](https://automaticdai.github.io/realtime-embedded-conferences/).

## Biography

Xiaotian Dai is a research associate at the University of York, UK. He received a PhD degree from University of York in 2019 (with Best Thesis). He joined real-time systems group in 2015 as a PhD research student, supervised by Prof. Alan Burns. His PhD research involves cooperatively design of control system and real-time task scheduling for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Various flexible scheduling task models and methods are proposed and implemented to investigate the scheduling impact on control performance.
He received a M.Sc. in Control Systems from the University of Sheffield in 2014, and a B.Sc. in Automatic Control in 2011.
He serves as a reviewer and a PC member for many real-time and design automation conferences.
