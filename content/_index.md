I am a research associate in the [Real-Time Systems Research Group (RTSRG)](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/index.html) at the University of York, UK. 
I am currently working on the MOCHA research project, which focuses on modelling and scheduling of complex architectures with high performance and stringent timing requirements.
Before this I worked on the DEIS project, which involves model-based safety assurance (SACM) that is applicable to autonomous and cyber-physical systems, collaborated with AVL, Siemens, General Motor and Fraunhofer.

I received a DPhil in 2019 (Best Thesis) in the Computer Science Department at University of York. I joined RTSRG in 2015 as a PhD student, supervised by [Prof. Alan Burns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/) and [Prof. Neil Audsley](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~neil/Neil_Audsley.html). My PhD research involves cooperatively design of control system and real-time task scheduling for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Flexible scheduling task models and methods are proposed and implemented to investigate the scheduling impact on control performance.
I was awarded MSc in 2014 in Control Systems at the University of Sheffield, and a BSc (2011) in Automatic Control in China. During my undergraduate and postgraduate study, I was involved in a wide range of autonomous robot research and developments.

I am also a robot enthusiast and a strong believer in a future with AI & robots. Find more about my robotic projects in [this post](http://xiaotiandai.com/robots/).

If you want to learn more about real-time systems, I have a personal blog on this: [Real-time System Blog](http://blog.xiaotiandai.com).
