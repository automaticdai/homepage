## About
Hi, my name is Steven. I am currently a Lecturer (equivalent to Assistant Professor in the US) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of York, UK. I mainly work on scheduling and timing assurance, and to guarantee systems to meet their deadlines. I am the lead of the [Reflexible and Adaptive CPS lab](https://www.xiaotiandai.com/lab/) (ReFLEX).

My research focuses on the scheduling and verification of real-time cyber-physical systems, with a particular emphasis on timing analysis and enhancing scheduling flexibility and adaptability of safety-critical systems throughout their lifespan. I am particularly interested in applications involving cyber-physical systems, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. My work has contributed to the development of innovative modelling, scheduling and analysis techniques, digital twins for run-time improvement, and hardware for safety-critical embedded systems with strict timing constraints, many of which have been adopted by industry. I am actively involved in the robotics and autonomous systems (RAS) community, with a focus on ensuring safety, robustness, and resilience during their operation.

*Short Bio:*

I was a Research Associate on the [MOCHA research project](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/mocha/) from 2019-2023, working with [Prof. Iain Bate](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ijb/) and [Prof. Alan Burns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/) in the [Real-Time and Distributed Systems Research Group (RTDS)](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/index.html), funded by Huawei. The MOCHA project focuses on modelling, scheduling and allocation of complex many-core architectures that have high performance and stringent timing requirements, using novel methods including Digital Twins and cache-aware scheduling. The project is targeted at providing key techniques of the next-generation 5G/6G communication base stations.

Before MOCHA, I worked on the EU H2020 [DEIS project](https://deis-project.eu) in 2019 with [Prof. Tim Kelly](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/tpk) and [Prof. Ibrahim Habli](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/ihabli). The DEIS project involves developing model-based safety assurance language (using [Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM)](https://www.omg.org/spec/SACM/2.0/About-SACM/); now is an OMG standard) and tools that are applicable to model-based autonomous and cyber-physical systems. This project was collaborated with AVL, Siemens, General Motors and Fraunhofer.

I joined the real-time systems group at York in 2015 as a PhD student, supervised by [Prof. Alan Burns](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/), and I was awarded a PhD degree in 2019 with Best Thesis. I received an MSc with distinction in Automatic Control and Systems Engineering from the University of Sheffield in 2014, and a BSc in Automatic Control in 2011. I have published over 30 papers and also regularly serve as a TPC member and reviewer for various prestigious conferences and journals in the domains of real-time systems, embedded systems, robotics and design automation.
