# Research
## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of real-time embedded systems (RTES), cyber-physical systems (CPS), and robotics and autonomous systems (RAS). The overarching vision is to advance the development of adaptive, safe, and predictable engineering systems. My key research areas include:

- Real-time scheduling and allocation on multi-cores, network-on-chips (NoC) and time-sensitive networks (TSN);
- Flexible, feedback-driven approaches to resource scheduling of CPS, including multi-robot and transportation systems;
- Digital Twins for the design, simulation, verification, and optimisation of CPS;
- Hardware-software co-design, and investigate timing-predictable hardware;
- Timing assurance of mixed-criticality and safety-critical systems.

*Collaborations:* I am working with academics and companies from UK, US, France, Germany, Portugal and China (mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong), and I am open to collaborations related to these topics and fields, addressing open problems and grand challenges both from industry and academia, with a focus on timing and scheduling, and applications in real-time embedded systems, cyber-physical systems and autonomous systems.
