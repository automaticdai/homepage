## For potential PhD students 

If you are interested to apply for a PhD, I am happy to supervise the following topics:

1. Novel scheduling and allocation methods for real-time systems
2. Inteference and contention modelling and analysis of multi-cores
3. Scheduling on complex architetures, including many-cores and CPU-GPU hetergeneous platforms
4. Timing assurance of robotic and autonomous systems using, for example, formal methods
5. Multi-robot systems scheduling, management and coordination

Please drop me an email (xiaotian.dai (at) york.ac.uk) if you want to discuss this further. I am happy to discuss immature ideas and would be appreciated if a more detailed proposal can be provided to ease the discussion. The entry date for PhDs is normally in October, but other starting date can be settled.
