#### *For Prospective PhD students:* 

Note that a PhD programme is a commitment of 3-4 years of hard work, and you should have the expectation that this is a hard path to go, and not everyone can finish it. If you are (still) interested to apply for a PhD, I am happy to supervise the following research topics:

1. Novel scheduling and allocation methods for real-time systems
2. Inteference and contention modelling and analysis of multi-cores
3. Scheduling on complex architetures, including many-cores and CPU-GPU hetergeneous platforms
4. Timing assurance of robotic and autonomous systems using, for example, probabilistic models and formal methods
5. Multi-robot systems scheduling, management and coordination
6. Design and verification of Cyber-Physical Systems

Please drop me an email (xiaotian.dai (at) york.ac.uk) if you want to discuss this further. I am happy to discuss immature ideas and would be appreciated if a more detailed proposal can be provided to ease the discussion. The entry date for PhDs is normally in October, but other starting date can be settled.
