## PhD Supervision

Current PhD students:

- Zou Jie, _Resource Efficient and Resillient Mixed-Criticality Scheduling for Autonomous Driving Systems_, co-supervised (2019-)

---

*For potential PhD students:* 

I am interesed to supervise the following PhD topics:

- Novel scheduling and allocation methods and models for real-time systems;
- Inteference and contention modelling and analysis of multi-cores;
- Scheduling on multi-cores / CPU-GPU hetergeneous platforms;
- Timing assurance of robotic and autonomous systems;
- Multi-robot systems scheduling, management and coordination. 

Please be aware that, by the university policy, I am only able to _co-supervise_ PhD students with a primary supervisor in place who is a permanent university staff (with title Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Reader/Processor). Please do submit PhD applications to the primary supervisor but include me if you want my co-surpervision. I am happy to give more information on request.
