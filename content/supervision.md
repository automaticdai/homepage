## ➤ PhD Research Students Supervision

I am interesed to supervise the following PhD topics:

- Timing assurance of CPU-GPU hetergeneous platform;
- Task scheduling and assurance of autonomous driving systems;
- Inteference and contention analysis of multi-cores;
- Multi-agent systems scheduling, management and coordination; 
- Scheduling of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System).


Please be aware that, by the university policy, I am only able to _co-supervise_ PhD students with a primary supervisor in place who is a permanent university staff (with title Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Reader/Processor). Please do submit PhD applications to the primary supervisor but include me if you want my co-surpervision. I am happy to give more information on request.

Current PhD students:

- Zou Jie, _Resource Efficient Real-Time Scheduling for Autonomous Driving Systems_, co-supervised with John McDermid (2019-2022)


## ➤ MSc Projects Supervision

- Zhijian Wang, _Priority Assignment Algorithms in Multiprocessor Real-Time Systems with Shared Resources_ (2021)
- Zixun Yu, _Smart Intersection Control with Back-Pressure Algorithms_, co-supervised (2021)



## ➤ Undergraduate Final Year Projects

- Dean Kenny, _Simulation and Latency Analysis of Time Sensitive Networks_ (2021)
- Jay Brooks, _Large Scale Scheduling of Time Sensitive Networks_, co-supervised (2021)

I am also open for the following student projects:

- Dynamic geo-fencing for safety of mobile robot systems
