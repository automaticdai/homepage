#### *For prospective PhD students:*

Note that a PhD programme is a commitment of 3-4 years of hard work, and you should have the expectation that this is a hard path to go, and not everyone can finish it. If you are (still) interested to apply for a PhD, please continue to read ---

I am happy to supervise the following research directions with some example topics:

- (R.1) Scheduling and allocation of real-time systems
    - Novel scheduling and allocation methods for real-time systems
    - Inteference and contention modelling and analysis on multi- and many-cores
    - Scheduling on complex architetures, including many-cores and CPU-GPU hetergeneous platforms
- (R.2) Addressing timing problems in Robotics and AI
    - Timing assurance of robotic and autonomous systems using, for example, probabilistic models and formal methods
    - Multi-robot systems scheduling, management and coordination
    - Timing analysis of ROS 2 executors
- (R.3) Design and verification of Long-lived Cyber-Physical Systems
    - Using digital twin to develop and improve CPS
    - Formal verification of CPS
- (R.4) Hardware for real-time systems and internet-of-things
    - Efficient, safe, secure hardware for RTS and IoT applications.
    - Instruction set architecture (ISA) for real-time systems.

Please drop me an email (xiaotian.dai (at) york.ac.uk) if you want to discuss this further. I am happy to discuss immature ideas and would be appreciated if a more detailed proposal can be provided to ease the discussion. The entry date for PhDs is normally in October, but other starting date can be settled.
