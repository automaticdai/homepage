## PhD Supervision

I am interesed to supervise the following PhD topics:

- Scheduling of CPU-GPU hetergeneous platform;
- Timing assurance of robotic and autonomous systems;
- Inteference and contention modelling and analysis of multi-cores;
- Multi-agent systems scheduling, management and coordination. 

Current PhD students:

- Zou Jie, _Resource Efficient Real-Time Scheduling for Autonomous Driving Systems_, co-supervised (2019-)


Please be aware that, by the university policy, I am only able to _co-supervise_ PhD students with a primary supervisor in place who is a permanent university staff (with title Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Reader/Processor). Please do submit PhD applications to the primary supervisor but include me if you want my co-surpervision. I am happy to give more information on request.


## MSc Research Projects

- Zhijian Wang, _Priority Assignment Algorithms in Multiprocessor Real-Time Systems with Shared Resources_ (2021)
- Zixun Yu, _Smart Intersection Control with Back-Pressure Algorithms_, co-supervised (2021)


## Undergraduate Final Year Projects

Projects available:

- Simulating and improving the scheduling in Time-Sensitive Networks
- Large scale scheduling of Time-Sensitive Networks
- Time-aware geo-fencing for mobile robots

Previous students:

- Dean Kenny (2021)
- Jay Brooks, co-supervised (2021)
