## PhD Supervision

*\[For potential PhD students\]* 

I am interesed to supervise the following PhD topics:

- Novel scheduling and allocation methods and models for real-time systems;
- Inteference and contention modelling and analysis of multi-cores;
- Scheduling on multi-cores / CPU-GPU hetergeneous platforms;
- Timing assurance of robotic and autonomous systems;
- Multi-robot systems scheduling, management and coordination. 

Please drop me an email if you want to discuss this further.

Current PhD students:

- Zou Jie, *Safety-Driven Timing-Predictable and Resource-Efficient Scheduling for Autonomous Systems*, co-supervised with Prof. John McDermid (2019-)
