## ➤ Undergraduate / MSc Projects supervision

Students that I am supervised, or co-surpervised:

- MSc, Zhijian Wang, _Priority Assignment Algorithms in Multiprocessor Real-Time Systems with Shared Resources_ (2021)
- MSc, Zixun Yu, _Smart Intersection Control with Back-Pressure Algorithms_, co-supervised (2021)
- UG, Dean Kenny, _Simulation and Latency Analysis of Time Sensitive Networks_ (2021)
- UG, Jay Brooks, _Large Scale Scheduling of Time Sensitive Networks_, co-supervised (2021)



## ➤ PhD supervision

Current PhD students:

- Zou Jie, _Resource Efficient Real-Time Scheduling for Autonomous Driving Systems_, co-supervised (2019-2022)

I am interesed in the following PhD topics:

- Timing assurance of CPU-GPU hetergeneous platform 
- Task scheduling and assurance of autonomous driving
- Inteference analysis of multi-cores
- Multi-agent systems scheduling and coordination 
- Scheduling in Real-Time Linux and ROS 2


Please be aware that, by the university policy, I am only able to _co-supervise_ PhD students with a primary supervisor in place who is a permanent university staff (with title Lecture/Senior Lecture/Reader/Processor). Please do submit PhD applications to the primary supervisor but include me if you want my co-surpervision. I am happy to give more information on request.
