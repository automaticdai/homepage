### - PhD Supervision

Please be aware that, by university policy, I am only able to **co-supervise** PhD students with a primary supervisor who is a permanent university employee. Any staff with the title Lecture/Reader/Professor is considered as a permanent staff. Hence, please do submit PhD applications to the primary supervisor other than me. I am happy to provide more information if needed.
