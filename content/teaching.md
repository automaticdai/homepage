- Scheduling and simulation of Time-Sensitve Networks

Please submit your application following the university project instructions. You can contact me before submission if you want to enquiry more details on each project.


### ➤ PhD Supervision

Current PhD students:

- 2019-, Zou Jie, Resource Efficient Real-Time Scheduling for Autonomous Driving Systems (co-supervised)

Currently PhD topics for application:

- Timing assurance of CPU-GPU hetergeneous platform 
- Scheduling and assurance of autonomous driving and robots

Please be aware that, by the university policy, I am only able to **co-supervise** PhD students with a primary supervisor in place who is a permanent university staff (with title Lecture/Senior Lecture/Reader/Processor). Please do submit PhD applications to the primary supervisor but include me if you want my co-surpervision. I am happy to give more information on request.
