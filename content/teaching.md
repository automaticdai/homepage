## ➤ Undergraduate Courses

I am/was a Teaching Assistant for the following modules @University of York:

- DART: Design of Analysable Real-Time Systems (Spring 2019-2020)
- EMPR-II: Embedded System Projects II (Autumn 2016-2017)
- EMPR-I: Embedded System Projects I (Spring 2016-2017)
- MFCS: Mathematical Foundations of Computer Systems (Spring 2016-2017)
- PROM: Programmable Microcontroller (Summer 2015-2016, Summer 2016-2017)
- ICAR: Introduction to Computer Architecture (Spring 2015-2016)



## ➤ Undergraduate / MSc Projects supervision

Students that I am supervised, or co-surpervised:

- MSc, Zhijian Wang, _Priority Assignment Algorithms in Multiprocessor Real-Time Systems with Shared Resources_ (2021)
- MSc, Zixun Yu, _Smart Intersection Control with Back-Pressure Algorithms_, co-supervised (2021)
- UG, Dean Kenny, _Simulation and Latency Analysis of Time Sensitive Networks_ (2021)
- UG, Jay Brooks, _Large Scale Scheduling of Time Sensitive Networks_ (2021)



## ➤ PhD supervision

Current PhD students:

- Zou Jie, _Resource Efficient Real-Time Scheduling for Autonomous Driving Systems_, co-supervised (2019-2022)

I am interesed in the following PhD topics:

- Timing assurance of CPU-GPU hetergeneous platform 
- Task scheduling and assurance of autonomous driving
- Scheduling of multi-agent systems 
- Real-Time Linux and ROS 2


Please be aware that, by the university policy, I am only able to _co-supervise_ PhD students with a primary supervisor in place who is a permanent university staff (with title Lecture/Senior Lecture/Reader/Processor). Please do submit PhD applications to the primary supervisor but include me if you want my co-surpervision. I am happy to give more information on request.
