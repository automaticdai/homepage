## 2. PhD Opportunities

A PhD at ReFLEX Lab is a transformative 3-4 year journey where you'll conduct groundbreaking research, develop deep expertise, and contribute to advancing the state-of-the-art in real-time systems and cyber-physical systems. You'll join a supportive community of researchers working on projects that have real-world impact.

### What You'll Gain

- **Deep Expertise**: Become a leading expert in your chosen research area
- **Research Skills**: Learn to identify problems, design solutions, and validate your work
- **Professional Network**: Build connections with leading researchers and industry professionals
- **Career Flexibility**: Open doors to careers in academia, industry R&D, or entrepreneurship
- **Personal Growth**: Develop resilience, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills

### Research Directions

I'm excited to supervise PhD students in the following areas. Each direction offers exciting opportunities to make significant contributions:

#### **(R.1) Scheduling and Allocation of Real-Time Systems**
Design the next generation of scheduling algorithms for complex computing platforms. Work on:
- Novel scheduling methods for multi-core and many-core systems
- Interference and contention modeling for modern architectures
- Scheduling on heterogeneous platforms (CPU-GPU, CPU-FPGA)
- Real-time guarantees for safety-critical applications

*Why it matters*: As systems become more complex, efficient scheduling is crucial for autonomous vehicles, aerospace systems, and industrial automation.

#### **(R.2) Digital Twins for Real-Time Embedded Systems**
Build virtual replicas that enable real-time monitoring, optimization, and verification. Explore:
- Dynamic modeling and verification of real-time systems
- Using digital twins to improve scheduling and resource allocation
- Fault and hazard identification through simulation
- Predictive maintenance and performance optimization

*Why it matters*: Digital twins are revolutionizing how we design, operate, and maintain complex systems — from aircraft to smart factories.

#### **(R.3) Timing Assurance in Robotics and AI**
Ensure robots and AI systems meet strict timing requirements. Investigate:
- Timing assurance for robotic and autonomous systems
- Multi-robot coordination and scheduling
- Timing analysis of ROS2 executors and robotic frameworks
- Probabilistic models and formal methods for timing guarantees

*Why it matters*: As robots become more prevalent in warehouses, manufacturing, and daily life, ensuring they operate safely and predictably is critical.

#### **(R.4) Design and Verification of Long-Lived Cyber-Physical Systems**
Develop methods to ensure CPS remain safe and reliable over their entire lifetime. Focus on:
- Using digital twins for continuous system improvement
- Formal verification techniques for CPS
- Adaptive systems that evolve safely over time
- Long-term reliability and maintenance strategies

*Why it matters*: Many CPS operate for decades (e.g., aircraft, power plants). Ensuring their safety throughout their lifetime is a grand challenge.

#### **(R.5) Hardware for Real-Time Systems and Internet-of-Things**
Design efficient, safe, and secure hardware for real-time applications. Work on:
- Specialized hardware for real-time and IoT applications
- Instruction set architectures (ISA) optimized for real-time systems
- Hardware-software co-design for timing predictability
- Security-enhanced processors for critical systems

*Why it matters*: Hardware design is fundamental to system performance and security. Projects like SCHEME are developing next-generation processors for aerospace.
