## For prospective PhD students

A PhD programme is a rewarding 3-4 year journey that offers the opportunity to conduct cutting-edge research, develop expertise in your field, and contribute to advancing knowledge in real-time systems and cyber-physical systems. While it requires dedication and perseverance, the experience provides invaluable skills, international collaborations, and career opportunities in both academia and industry.

**Research directions:**

I am happy to supervise the following research directions with some example topics:

- (R.1) Scheduling and allocation of real-time systems
    - Novel scheduling and allocation methods for real-time systems
    - Interference and contention modelling and analysis on multi- and many-cores
    - Scheduling on complex architectures, including many-cores and CPU-GPU heterogeneous platforms
- (R.2) Digital Twins for real-time embedded systems
    - Dynamic modelling and verification of real-time systems
    - Use digital twins to improve scheduling and allocation of real-time systems
    - Fault and hazard identification using digital twins
- (R.3) Addressing timing problems in Robotics and AI
    - Timing assurance of robotic and autonomous systems using, for example, probabilistic models and formal methods
    - Multi-robot systems scheduling, management and coordination
    - Timing analysis of ROS 2 executors
- (R.4) Design and verification of Long-lived Cyber-Physical Systems
    - Using digital twin to develop and improve CPS
    - Formal verification of CPS
- (R.5) Hardware for real-time systems and internet-of-things
    - Efficient, safe, secure hardware for RTS and IoT applications.
    - Instruction set architecture (ISA) for real-time systems.

Please drop me an email (xiaotian.dai (at) york.ac.uk) if you want to discuss this further. I am happy to discuss early-stage ideas and would appreciate it if a more detailed proposal ([details are here](https://www.york.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/apply/documents/proposal/)) could be provided to facilitate a more productive discussion. The standard entry time for PhDs is normally in October and April, but other starting dates can be settled.

**About funding:**
- The department is offering a limited number of studentships, [details can be found here](https://www.york.ac.uk/computer-science/study/postgraduate-research/funding/).
