# Opportunities
## 1. For prospective PhD students

Note that a PhD programme is a commitment of 3-4 years of hard work. You should have the expectation that this is a hard path to go, and not everyone can finish it. If you are (still) interested in applying for a PhD, please continue to read ---

I am happy to supervise the following research directions with some example topics:

- (R.1) Scheduling and allocation of real-time systems
    - Novel scheduling and allocation methods for real-time systems
    - Interference and contention modelling and analysis on multi- and many-cores
    - Scheduling on complex architectures, including many-cores and CPU-GPU heterogeneous platforms
- (R.2) Digital Twins for real-time embedded systems
    - Dynamic modelling and verification of real-time systems
    - Use digital twins to improve scheduling and allocation of real-time systems
    - Fault and hazard identification using digital twins
- (R.3) Addressing timing problems in Robotics and AI
    - Timing assurance of robotic and autonomous systems using, for example, probabilistic models and formal methods
    - Multi-robot systems scheduling, management and coordination
    - Timing analysis of ROS 2 executors
- (R.4) Design and verification of Long-lived Cyber-Physical Systems
    - Using digital twin to develop and improve CPS
    - Formal verification of CPS
- (R.5) Hardware for real-time systems and internet-of-things
    - Efficient, safe, secure hardware for RTS and IoT applications.
    - Instruction set architecture (ISA) for real-time systems.

Please drop me an email (xiaotian.dai (at) york.ac.uk) if you want to discuss this further. I am happy to discuss immature ideas and would appreciate it if a more detailed proposal ([details are here](https://www.york.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/apply/documents/proposal/)) could be provided to ease the discussion. The standard entry time for PhDs is normally in October and April, but other starting dates can be settled.

The department is offering a limited number of studentships, [details can be found here](https://www.york.ac.uk/computer-science/study/postgraduate-research/funding/). There are also opportunities from our CDT centers [SAINTS Safe AI](https://www.york.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/centres-doctoral-training/safe-ai-training/) and [iGGi](https://www.iggi-phd.org/). If you are from China, please find details on the [China Scholarships Council Scholarship (CSC)](https://www.york.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/funding/china-council-scholarships/).


## 2. Guide to PhD/Professor visitors

If you are a PhD student, or a Professor from a UK or non-UK university,
- Please check [this information page](https://www.york.ac.uk/computer-science/research/academic-visitors/) for more details on visiting our lab.
- Information on visa can be found [here](https://www.york.ac.uk/admin/hr/working-in-the-uk/visitor-visas/about/).

For more information, please contact me via email (xiaotian.dai (at) york.ac.uk).


## 3. Guide to UG/MSc students

ReFLEX lab is open for supervising undergraduate/MSc projects related to cyber-physical systems, some examples are:

- Scheduling of large groups of robots in warehouse
- Simulating and improving the scheduling in Time-Sensitive Networks
- Large-scale scheduling of Time-Sensitive Networks
- Traffic scheduling for smart transportation
- Discrete simulation of Routerless Network-on-Chips
- ......

For more details, please look at the departmental project lists. We also accept self-defined projects should that align with the lab research objectives.
