# DEIS: Dependability Engineering Innovation for CPS

*(2018 - 2019) RA, University of York*  
*Funded by EU Horizon 2020, £313,415*

## Project Overview

Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS) provide the potential for vast economic and societal impact in domains such as automotive, health care and home automation. The open and cooperative nature of CPS poses a significant new challenge in assuring dependability. The DEIS project addresses this important and unsolved challenge by developing technologies that enable a science of dependable system integration.

Such technologies facilitate the efficient synthesis of components and systems based on their dependability information. The key innovation in the approach of the DEIS project is the concept of Digital Dependability Identity (DDI). A DDI contains all the information that uniquely describes the dependability characteristics of a CPS component. DDIs are used for the integration of components into systems during development as well as for the dynamic integration of systems into systems of systems in the field.

## Key Innovation: Digital Dependability Identity (DDI)

The Digital Dependability Identity (DDI) is a comprehensive digital representation that contains all the information uniquely describing the dependability characteristics of a CPS component. DDIs serve multiple purposes:

1. **Development Integration**: Facilitating the integration of components into systems during development
2. **Dynamic Integration**: Enabling the dynamic integration of systems into systems of systems in the field
3. **Dependability Assurance**: Providing a standardized way to communicate and verify dependability properties
4. **System Synthesis**: Supporting efficient synthesis of components and systems based on dependability information

## Project Objectives

The DEIS project aims to:

- Develop technologies for dependable system integration
- Create standardized approaches for dependability assurance
- Enable efficient synthesis of CPS components
- Support both static and dynamic system integration
- Address the challenges of open and cooperative CPS

## Research Contributions

The project has contributed to:
- **Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM)**: Now an OMG standard
- **Model-based safety assurance** techniques
- **Digital Dependability Identity** concepts
- **Tool development** for model-based autonomous and cyber-physical systems

## Project Partners

The project involved collaboration with industry partners including AVL, Siemens, General Motors, and Fraunhofer, working together to develop model-based autonomous and cyber-physical systems.
