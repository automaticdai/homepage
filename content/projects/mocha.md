# MOCHA: Modelling and Optimising Complex Heterogenous Architectures

## Project Overview

The applications and resources (processors, networks and memory) for real-time systems are becoming ever more complex to understand, control and maintain. This has led to research into building statistical models of systems and adaptive policies based on these statistical models.

The key challenges that emerge are whether the models reflect how the system would behave during operation, how systems should deal with unexpected or rarely occurring scenarios, and then how to optimise systems based on the behaviours of the systems. It is specifically to address the high overheads of current systems and the low cache hit rates that are currently achieved.

## Project Objectives

The MOCHA project focuses on:

1. **Statistical Modeling**: Building accurate statistical models of complex heterogeneous architectures
2. **Adaptive Policies**: Developing adaptive policies based on statistical models
3. **System Optimization**: Optimizing systems based on behavioral analysis
4. **Cache Performance**: Addressing low cache hit rates in current systems
5. **Overhead Reduction**: Minimizing high overheads in current systems

## Key Research Areas

- **Cache-aware scheduling** for multi-core systems
- **Digital twin development** for real-time systems
- **Statistical modeling** of system behavior
- **Adaptive resource allocation** strategies
- **Performance optimization** techniques

## Project Outcomes

The project has contributed to several publications and research advances in:
- Cache-aware DAG scheduling methods
- Digital twin applications for real-time systems
- Statistical modeling approaches for complex architectures
